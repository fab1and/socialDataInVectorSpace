## Evaluation of distributed representation of social network data in vector space

Alternative investments have gained popularity in recent years due to high return on investments. However, data sources to validate possible targets, e. g. in the Private Equity and Venture
Capital industry, are incomplete and rare. Alternative data can fill the gap to some extent. One
example are social networks. The creation of a distributed representation of documents and
words resulting from social network scraping can be structured, analysed and used for deeper
analysis. Either for topic modeling or for more specific applications. Top2Vec by Angelov, 2020
creates a vector space that semantically represents documents 𝐶 and its associated words 𝑉
in order to retrieve topics and corresponding topic vectors 𝑡®. With the additional help of the
concepts of cosine similarity and sentiment analysis, it is possible to perform deeper analysis
on the companies’ product, associated language and competitor benchmarking leading to a
supportive tool, called Customer2Vec. The creation of such an application in order to gain an
overview from an investor’s point of view is the topic of this thesis
